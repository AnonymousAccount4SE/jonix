This is how to create a separate git repository of the 'gh-pages' branch:

	cd [the home directory of the project]
	git clone -b gh-pages --single-branch https://github.com/zach-m/jonix.git gh-pages

Once cloned, you can copy into it the javadocs created by:

	mvn clean javadoc:javadoc

and placed under:

	target/site/apidocs
